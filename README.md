# Reinforcement-Learning-Project
Algorithmic trading using RL 


The project evaluates the efficiency of deep-q-networks in
the task of automated trading. A MDP formulation of the trading task
is proposed and the optimal action function is learnt using a neural network. Transaction costs and liquidity constraints are taken into account.
The agents are trained and evaluated on real-life cryptocurrency instruments like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The results show that the proposed
method does well on learning short term trends and are able to profit
well.
